# Project Scope and Accomplishments

This document outlines the current scope and accomplishments of the Crypto Analysis Application, followed by a plan for future enhancements.

## I. Current Project Scope

The Crypto Analysis Application provides real-time and historical analysis of the cryptocurrency market, enabling users to monitor trends, analyze sentiment, and make informed decisions.

**Key Features:**

*   **Market Overview:** Displays live market data, trending coins, and global market statistics.
*   **Price Prediction:** Forecasts future cryptocurrency prices using machine learning models.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Provides real-time sentiment analysis of crypto news, overall market sentiment, individual currency sentiment, and the Fear & Greed Index.
*   **Advanced Analysis:** Offers correlation analysis between the cryptocurrency market and broader financial markets (e.g., S&P 500), and calculates volatility for individual cryptocurrencies.
*   **Individual Currency Analysis:** Presents detailed historical data and technical indicators for specific cryptocurrencies.

**Architecture:**

*   **Frontend:** Developed with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive user interface. Utilizes Chart.js for data visualization and Axios for API communication.
*   **Backend:** A Python Flask API serving RESTful endpoints for market data, sentiment analysis, and price predictions.
*   **Data Sources:** Integrates data from CoinGecko (market data), NewsAPI (news headlines), yfinance (historical data), and leverages custom-trained machine learning models.

## II. Accomplishments (What has been done)

### 1. Core Application Setup
- [x] **Frontend Framework:** React application initialized with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- [x] **Backend Framework:** Flask API set up with CORS enabled.
- [x] **Basic Routing:** Implemented navigation for Market Overview, Price Prediction, Advanced Analysis, and Individual Currency Analysis pages.

### 2. Market Data Integration
- [x] **Live Market Data:** Endpoints to fetch and display live cryptocurrency prices.
- [x] **Trending & Global Data:** Functionality to retrieve trending coins and global market statistics.
- [x] **Historical Data:** API endpoints for fetching historical price data for various cryptocurrencies, including technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).
- [x] **Top Movers:** Implemented fetching of top gainers and losers.

### 3. Price Prediction Models
- [x] **Regression Model:** Implemented an XGBoost model for predicting future cryptocurrency prices, incorporating historical data, technical indicators, and sentiment scores.
- [x] **Direction Prediction Model:** Implemented an LSTM model to predict the direction of price movement (up/down).
- [x] **Model Training & Persistence:** Functionality to train and save both prediction models, along with their respective scalers and performance metrics (MAE for regression, accuracy for direction).
- [x] **Feature Engineering:** Incorporated various technical indicators and sentiment scores as features for prediction models.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis
- [x] **News Sentiment:** Real-time sentiment analysis of crypto news headlines using NewsAPI and a custom-trained sentiment model.
- [x] **Overall Market Sentiment:** Aggregated sentiment analysis across multiple news articles to determine overall market sentiment.
- [x] **Individual Currency Sentiment:** Sentiment analysis for specific cryptocurrencies based on news related to them.
- [x] **Fear & Greed Index:** Integration to fetch and display the Fear & Greed Index.
- [x] **Sentiment Model Training:** A Logistic Regression model trained on the Sentiment140 dataset using TF-IDF vectorization for text processing (`train_sentiment_model.py`).

### 5. Advanced Analysis Features
- [x] **S&P 500 Correlation:** Analysis and display of correlation between S&P 500 and cryptocurrency market.
- [x] **Correlation Matrix:** Generation of a correlation matrix for selected cryptocurrencies.
- [x] **Volatility Calculation:** Functionality to calculate and display volatility for individual cryptocurrencies.

## III. Project Improvement Plan (Future Enhancements)

This section outlines future enhancements and features for the crypto analysis application.

### 1. Prediction Model Enhancements
- [ ] **Advanced Feature Engineering:**
  - [ ] **On-Chain Metrics:** Active Wallet Addresses, Transaction Volume & Count, Network Hash Rate.
  - [ ] **Macroeconomic Data:** S&P 500 / Nasdaq Composite, US Dollar Index (DXY), Inflation Rates (CPI).
- [ ] **Advanced Model Exploration:**
  - [ ] **Prophet:** Investigate for time-series with seasonal patterns.

### 2. New Value-Added Features
- [ ] **Portfolio Tracker:**
  - Allow users to input their crypto holdings.
  - Track real-time portfolio value.
  - Display Profit & Loss (P&L) metrics.
  - Visualize asset allocation with a pie chart.
- [ ] **Real-Time Alerting System:**
  - Price alerts for specific crypto targets.
  - Sentiment shift alerts.
  - Technical indicator alerts (e.g., RSI crossing a threshold).
- [ ] **Expanded Data Visualization:**
  - [ ] Overlay technical indicators on price charts.
  - [ ] Create dedicated charts for on-chain metrics.
  - [ ] Display results of various analyses (e.g., macroeconomic, correlation) on the Market Analysis page.

### 3. Performance & Architecture
- [ ] **API Performance:**
  - [ ] Implement a caching mechanism for the sentiment analysis endpoint to avoid real-time recalculation on every call. Pre-calculate and store results in a JSON file.

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements (Ongoing)
- [ ] Continue refining the user interface for a professional, seamless look (e.g., Coinbase/Binance style).

### 5. Sub-final Improvements
- [ ] **Future Sentiment Features:**
  - [ ] Display top 5 currency overall sentiment on a daily basis (frontend aggregation/display).
