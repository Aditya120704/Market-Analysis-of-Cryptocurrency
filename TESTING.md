# Software Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the Crypto Analysis Application. The plan is designed to ensure the quality, reliability, and performance of the application, and to provide a clear roadmap for all testing activities.

## 2. Test Objectives

The primary objectives of this test plan are to:

*   Verify that the application meets all specified requirements.
*   Ensure that the application is free of critical defects.
*   Validate that the application performs as expected in a production-like environment.
*   Identify and mitigate any potential risks to the quality, reliability, or performance of the application.

## 3. Test Scope

This test plan covers all aspects of the Crypto Analysis Application, including:

*   **Frontend:** All UI components, pages, and user interactions.
*   **Backend:** All API endpoints, business logic, and data processing.
*   **Integration:** The communication and data exchange between the frontend and backend.

## 4. Test Strategy

This test plan will employ a multi-faceted test strategy that includes:

*   **Static Testing:**
    *   **Reviews:** A thorough review of all project documentation, including the `README.md`, `project_plan.md`, and this test plan.
    *   **Inspections:** A detailed inspection of the source code to identify any potential defects or areas for improvement.
*   **Dynamic Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** To verify the functionality of individual components and functions.
    *   **Integration Tests:** To ensure that the frontend and backend are working together correctly.
    *   **System Tests:** To validate the end-to-end functionality of the application.
    *   **Performance Tests:** To assess the performance and scalability of the application under various load conditions.
    *   **Security Tests:** To identify and mitigate any potential security vulnerabilities.

## 5. Test Schedule

The testing will be conducted in the following phases:

*   **Phase 1: Foundational Analysis and Test Scoping (1-2 days)**
*   **Phase 2: Test Planning and Design (2-3 days)**
*   **Phase 3: Test Execution and Reporting (3-5 days)**
*   **Phase 4: Post-Implementation Analysis and Continuous Improvement (1-2 days)**

## 6. Test Environment

The testing will be conducted in a dedicated test environment that is as close to the production environment as possible. The test environment will include:

*   **Hardware:** A dedicated server for the backend and a variety of client machines for the frontend.
*   **Software:** The latest versions of all required software, including Node.js, Python, and all project dependencies.
*   **Network:** A dedicated network connection to ensure that the testing is not impacted by network latency or other issues.

## 7. Test Tools

The following tools will be used for testing:

*   **Manual Testing:**
    *   Checklists and work papers from the "Effective Methods for Software Testing" document.
*   **Automated Testing:**
    *   `npm test` for running frontend unit tests.
    *   Postman for API testing.
    *   Selenium for end-to-end testing.

## 8. Defect Management

All defects will be logged and tracked using a formal defect management process. The process will include:

*   **Defect Logging:** All defects will be logged in a centralized defect tracking system.
*   **Defect Prioritization:** All defects will be prioritized based on their severity and impact.
*   **Defect Resolution:** All defects will be assigned to a developer for resolution.
*   **Defect Verification:** All resolved defects will be re-tested to ensure that they have been fixed correctly.
