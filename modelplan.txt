For building a daily cryptocurrency price predictor with about 75% accuracy or higher using deep learning, the key specifics based on existing state-of-the-art projects and research are as follows:

1. Data Requirements
Historical Daily Price Data with at least these columns:

Date

Open

High

Low

Close (most important target variable)

Adjusted Close

Volume

Time Span: Ideally, use 5-10 years of daily data if available (e.g., Bitcoin data from 2014 to 2024 used in many projects), but a minimum of 2 years (about 700+ trading days) is a practical start for decent model training and generalization.

Sources: CoinMarketCap, CryptoDataDownload, Yahoo Finance, Kaggle datasets.

Example dataset used in notable projects:

Bitcoin daily prices from 2014 to early 2024 with minute-level data aggregated into daily values.

Data should be cleaned to remove missing values, duplicates, and normalized using MinMaxScaler or similar techniques.

2. Model Selection
Core model:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network is the most widely validated architecture for daily price prediction in cryptocurrencies.

Model architecture typically consists of:

Multiple LSTM layers (e.g., 2-3 stacked layers),

Dropout layers to reduce overfitting,

Dense (fully connected) output layer for final price output.

Variants & Enhancements:

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) can be used alternatively but LSTM often slightly outperforms.

Use Change Point Detection (PELT algorithm) to detect regime shifts and feed that information to the LSTM for higher accuracy (improves RMSE by ~30%) .

Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) can be combined for auxiliary tasks or ensemble models.

3. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
Scale/Normalize features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.

Convert the time series into supervised learning format by creating sequences of fixed length (e.g., sequences of 30 days input features to predict the next dayâ€™s close price).

Include technical indicators (optional) like SMA, EMA, RSI as features to improve model learning .

Split data into train/test sets typically with an 80:20 ratio, ensuring chronological ordering to avoid lookahead bias.

4. Model Training
Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Optimizer: Adam optimizer is commonly used for better convergence.

Batch size: Typically 32 or 64.

Epochs: Between 50-100 epochs with early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.

Use dropout layers (~0.2-0.3) within LSTM to reduce overfitting.

5. Model Evaluation & Metrics
Evaluate with:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Directional accuracy can be computed by comparing predicted directional moves with actual ones.

Past projects show that LSTM models can achieve high predictive accuracy with RMSE far lower than naive models and directional accuracy approaching or exceeding 75% depending on dataset and feature engineering.

6. Summary Workflow Example (from Hugging Face & Kaggle projects)
Load dataset and explore it.

Clean data: fill or remove missing values, remove duplicates.

Normalize features: e.g., MinMaxScaler to scale prices between 0 and 1.

Create sequences: sliding window of 30 days to predict next day price.

Split dataset: 80% train, 20% test.

Build LSTM network:

python
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(sequence_length, feature_dim)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(1))  # output layer predicting next day's price
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
Train model with early stopping on validation loss.

Evaluate performance on test data with RMSE and directional accuracy.

Predict next day or next 60 days prices.

Conclusion
You should use at least 2 years of clean daily historical crypto data with key price features and train a stacked LSTM model with dropout using sequences of about 30 days as input. Normalize the data, split train/test 80:20, and use Adam optimizer with MSE loss. Optionally, apply Change Point Detection (PELT) to better handle sudden market regime changes. Following this approach based on recent successful projects, you can expect to reliably achieve around 75% directional accuracy on daily cryptocurrency price prediction.
